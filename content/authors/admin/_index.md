## About Me

Thuy-Kieu Truong is currentlycurrently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Manufacturing & Metrology Laboratory in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Hanbat National University, Korea. My research focuses on the development and optimization of super black coatings, particularly for advanced optical and solar energy applications.

With expertise in material science and engineering, I specialize in the growth of carbon nanostructures on hierarchical aluminum substrates using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. My work integrates innovative strategies, such as enhancing adhesion through substrate engineering and creating multi-level light trapping structures, to achieve superior stray light suppression in optical systems. This includes pioneering approaches to improving the performance of optical bevels by leveraging carbon nanostructure-based coatings.

Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical material design and practical engineering applications, fostering advancements in precision manufacturing and optical engineering.
